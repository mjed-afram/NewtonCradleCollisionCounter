# NewtonCradleCollisionCounter: Advanced Video Processing and Collision Detection System

This project leverages the power of OpenCV and custom algorithms to perform advanced video processing for object tracking and collision detection in real-time video streams. 
Developed for learning purposes and fun, it offers a hands-on approach to understanding and applying computer vision techniques. 
It's a cool project for anyone interested in diving into the world of video processing, and it lays the groundwork for more fun and innovative projects in the future.

## Features

- **HSV Segmentation**: Isolates objects based on color by converting video frames to the HSV color space and applying color-based segmentation.
- **Image Binarization**: Simplifies the video frame to a binary format for easier object detection and tracking.
- **Gap Filling**: Enhances object detection accuracy by filling gaps within detected objects in the binary image.
- **Coordinate Extraction**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to extract and track the coordinates of each object within the video frame.
- **Collision Detection**: Counts and reports collisions between tracked objects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NewtonCradleCollisionCounter.git
cd NewtonCradleCollisionCounter

Usage
To start processing a video file and detect collisions, 
run the main.py script with the path to your video file as an argument:
python main.py path/to/your/video.mp4

Link to the dataset will be provided soon......
